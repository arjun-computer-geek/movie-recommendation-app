A movie recommendation app
## Tasks:
- Make a recommendation app that suggests something to your users. Choose any topic (Travel, Food, Adventure, etc).
- This app should be similar to Goodbooks recommendation using React showed by Tanay in a Youtube video.
- You can choose to have different genres of something you're interested in: Music, Food, Travel, etc.
- List categories for the chosen genres for your recommendation app.
- When the user clicks on one category, display a list of items in that category with its details.
- Have at least 3 items in each category.
- Add Description and ratings for each item.
- Create the app with your design.
## Result:
I have made it with the reactjs and used a useState hooks. And learn a lot how to show the elements on the basic of conditional logic.
